      <h2>Who we are</h2>
      <p>
        Buddy Zone was founded by <strong>Mohammad Adyan</strong> to support NIOS students across India.
        We specialise in previous-year board paper practice, exam simulation, and competitive quizzes
        designed to build accuracy, speed, and confidence.
      </p>

      <h3>What we offer</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Past Papers Practice:</strong> Carefully curated past-year question sets with step-by-step solutions.</li>
        <li><strong>Exam Simulator:</strong> Time-bound mock exams that recreate board exam conditions so students learn time management and reduce mistakes.</li>
        <li><strong>Quiz Competitions:</strong> Regular timed quizzes that encourage revision and increase engagement.</li>
        <li><strong>Progress Tracking:</strong> Simple reports and tips so students and parents can see improvement areas.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>How it works</h3>
      <p>
        Students interact with our Telegram bot <strong>@genie01_bot</strong> to choose subjects, attempt tests,
        and join quizzes. For premium content and automated features, we provide secure payment links
        (Cashfree) that can be completed on mobile or web.
      </p>

      <h3>Our mission</h3>
      <p>
        To make board exam preparation simple, practice-focused, and accessible to all NIOS students so
        they can score better with less stress.
